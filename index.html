                    <h1>Maulik Chitkara</h1>
                    <p>I am a second year undergraduate student studying in IISER Mohali. I have an interest in some major fields within the domain of physics, mathematics and computational sciences. I am passionate about learning new things and curious about the universe. I am willing to learn and impliment computational methods to various fields to enhance the idea I have of those fields. I have an interest in learning mathematical concepts for the sake of their own beauty and relevance in other sciences. I am also interested in human psychology and social structure of our civilisation since they give rise to the most complex structure in existence. I like reading papers inspired by fictional universes and I believe that fiction and fantasy can often lead to implications that help us understand science itself.  </p>
                    <p>I love reading fantasy literature and watching movies based on such books such as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Lord of the Rings. I like listening to classical music, both Indian and Western. I often write poems dealing with various ideas such as destruction, various emotions and situations and sometimes just descriptions of some of my favourite masterpieces. I like maintaining my physical and mental fitness, and I like running, meditating and going to the gym. I am also the co-convener for the running club, Miles at IISER Mohali.</p>
